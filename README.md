# TicTacTask (frontend)

This is a pet project that was created in order to learn [Angular](https://angular.io). It is a simple web application
that allows to create task lists according to David Allen's [GTD system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done).

## Configuration

File `/src/assets/config.json` contains application configuration. The following configuration properties can be set:

```json
{
  "apiBaseUrl": "<Base URL of backed API>",
  "domain": "Application domain name (optional)"
}
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
